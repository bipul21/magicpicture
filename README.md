magicpicture
============


This script requires you python PIL library on your system.

Just run python magicpicture.py <path-to-image-file> <text-to-repeated in file>
Creates the file in same directory where .py is located.


Creates a webpage(html file) using a image file of which when the font size reduced magically forms the original image file. Could be used to say something to someone in a geeky way.


Feel free to get in touch or if you did something interesting with this.
